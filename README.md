# StreamingApp

Stream premium video content, host live watch parties, and manage your catalogue with a modern microservice architecture. The platform now ships with a production-ready admin portal, real-time chat, S3-backed adaptive streaming, and a redesigned cinematic frontend experience.

## Architecture

| Service | Port | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authService` | 3001 | User authentication, registration, JWT issuance |
| `streamingService` | 3002 | Video catalogue, S3 playback endpoints, public APIs |
| `adminService` | 3003 | Dedicated admin microservice for asset management and uploads |
| `chatService` | 3004 | Websocket + REST chat for live watch parties |
| `frontend` | 3000 | React SPA with revamped UI and integrated chat |
| `mongo` | 27017 | Shared MongoDB instance |

All backend services share common database models and utilities through `backend/common`.

## Environment Configuration

Each service reads its config from environment variables — see
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) at the repo root for the full list of
variable names each service expects (ports, Mongo URI, JWT secret, AWS/S3
settings, frontend build-time API URLs). Copy it to `.env` and fill in real
values locally; never commit the populated `.env` (already gitignored).

## Running with Docker Compose

1. Populate the environment variables above (or rely on the defaults baked into `docker-compose.yml`).
2. Build and start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the web app.

The compose file provisions MongoDB plus all four Node.js microservices. S3 credentials are optional for local testing—you can still browse seeded metadata, but streaming requires valid S3 objects.

## Local Development

Install dependencies for each service:

```bash
# auth service
cd backend/authService && npm install

# streaming service
cd ../streamingService && npm install

# admin service
cd ../adminService && npm install

# chat service
cd ../chatService && npm install

# frontend
cd ../../frontend && npm install
```

Run the services (in separate terminals) after starting MongoDB:

```bash
cd backend/authService && npm run dev
cd backend/streamingService && npm run dev
cd backend/adminService && npm run dev
cd backend/chatService && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm start
```

## Feature Highlights

- **S3-backed adaptive streaming** with secure signed uploads for admins.
- **Dedicated admin microservice** for video ingestion, metadata management, and featured curation.
- **Real-time chat** overlay in the player (Socket.IO + persistent message history).
- **Modern React experience** featuring cinematic hero sections, dynamic carousels, and responsive design.
- **Role-aware access control** across frontend routes and backend microservices.

## Testing

Automated tests are not yet included. Recommended smoke checks:

1. Register and log in through the web UI.
2. Upload a small video + thumbnail via the admin dashboard (requires valid S3 credentials).
3. Confirm playback from the browse page and verify that chat messages broadcast between multiple browser tabs.
